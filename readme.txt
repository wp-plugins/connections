Connections is a simple to use addressbook or business directory that is highly customizable.

== Description ==

Connections is a simple to use address book system but is also very versatile. You can use it to create church directories, business directories and even profiles using the default templates. If the default layouts donâ€™t suit your needs you can easily create your own custom template. Want to show a list of upcoming birthdays and anniversaries, no problem, you can do that too. Take a look at the screen shots and the samples on this site to see all Connections can do.
