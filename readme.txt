== Description ==

Connections is a simple to use address book system but is also very versatile. You can use it to create a church directory, business directory, staff directory and even profiles pages using the default templates. If the default layouts donâ€™t suit your needs you can easily create your own custom template. Want to show a list of upcoming birthdays and anniversaries, no problem, you can do that too. Take a look at the screen shots and the samples on this site to see all Connections can do.
